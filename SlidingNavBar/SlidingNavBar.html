		<h3> Sliding Navigation Bar </h3>
		<p>The nav bar shown here is a neat feature that can be added to your webpage. The highligher will slide over and fit to the width of the selected navigation bar item. With a few modifications, this model can be customized to fit any webpage. This tutorial will go over the javascript implementation and how to modify the CSS and HTML to integrate this navbar into any webpage. </p>
		<h4> JavaScript </h4>
		<p> The bulk of this implementation is contained in the scripts "showsection.js" and "slidenavbar.js". These can be added to a webprage in order to add the sliding nav bar functionality to hte webpage, provided the appropriate changes are made to the HTML and CSS. </p>
		<h5> Initialization </h5>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<p> When the webpage loads, initialize() is called. This selects the first list item by adding the class "selected" to the list item. It also centers the highlighter div vertically within the navbar. It does this by implementing a simple algorithm:</p>
		<ol style="list-style: ;">
			<li> Move the div halfway down the parent div (the nav bar). </li>
			<li> Move the div up half of its computed height, taking into account the padding and border-width </li>
		</ol>

		<p> After this, the highlighter div is in the correct postition, and the webpage is ready</p>
		<h5> Sliding </h5>
		<div class="divider"></div>
		<p> So, what happens when we click on a tab? First, we unselect the tab in the nav bar by toggling the class "selected" for the currently selected list item. We do the same to the section corresponding to the currently selected tab. Second, we move the highlight div to the clicked tab by taking the offset of the clicked list item and setting the highlighter's position to match. Finally, we toggle the "selected" class on the section we want to show. This displays the content pane by changing the display from "none" to "block" (see CSS).</p>
		<h4> CSS </h4>
		<p> What makes the content pane change is the definition of the "selected" class. The display is set to "none" for the class "content". The "selected" class has a block display to overwrite this. </p>
		<h4> Customization </h4>
		<p> This nav bar can be customized with the same functionality with a few simple changes. The "nav" class's height and color can be customized by changing those values in the file "main.css".</p>
		<p> The height and color of the highlighter can be changed as well in a similar manner. Other than these features, changing anything else in the classes associated with the nav bar would interfere with the current functionality of the highlighter. </p>
